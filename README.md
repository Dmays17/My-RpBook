#Welcome to MyRPBook!

Do you love food? Do you love to cook but can never seem to find your favoirte recipes or have them scattered about? 

##Well not anymore!

We made MyRPBook as a way of easily keeping all of your favorite recipes in one place, your MyBook!
Once you login in, you will be redirected to your MyBook where you can update your current recipes, delete old ones, or add new ones that you have found.

If you are looking for inspiration for your cooking, check out the World Book! Here you can search thousands of recipes to help spark your cookking. Each recipe will have a list of ingridients and a link to the full recipe to take a look at.

We always value feedback so if there are any feature you would like to see added or expanded upon, feel free to reach out to one of us and we can look into adding it.

#Happy Cooking!
